Operators ->
arithmentic operators -> + , -, *, / , %, //, ** 
 # in a+b -> a,b are oprands and + is operatoter and a+b is operation
 # in ++a -> a is oprand and ++ is operator and ++a is operation
 # a**b gives a ki power b and a ,b are oprands and ** is oparator and a**b is operation
comparison operators/relational operator -> >,<,<=,>=,==,!=. 
 #-> all these returns True or false for example is a is equals to b the a==b will return True and a!=b will return false
assignment operator -> =, +=,-=,/=,*=
 # they assigns the value mean if a=2 means 2 is assigned to a , a+=5(a=a+5) means add 5 to a and assign result to a
logical operator -> not, and , or 
  # not reverse means if a = False then not a will be True.not (5>8) will return true because 5>8 is false and not will give opposite that is true
  # and let two operations a and b both are true then a and b will be true otherwise a and b will be false 
  # let two operations a and b and if atleast one of them is true then a or b will true othherwise it will be false

operator precedence

not
and
or
uper se neeche uper higher precedence and neeche lower precedence
and for same precedence we will go left to right
for ex 10/2 * 5 -> / and * has same precedent so left to right first 10/2 = 5 then 5*5 = 25
